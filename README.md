# Global COVID-19 Response
## About:
This repository contains code to follow the Data Processing Pipeline for the Global Covid-19 Syndromic Surveillance Team - a partnership between sites at Partners in Health, the Global Health Research Core at Harvard Medical School, and Brigham and Women's Hospital. The data has been modified to respect the privacy of our sites, in hopes that other groups can benefit from the functions we have written.

This repository contains data, code, and other items needed to reproduce this work. Outputs include cleaned datasets, figures, reports, Shiny apps, and Leaflet maps. Further explanation of analysis and output use and construction is given in the "Overview of folders and files" section, which includes detailed explanations of the functions we have written.


## Goals:
The main goal of the Global COVID-19 Syndromic Survillance Team is to monitor changes in indicators that may signal changes in COVID-19 case numbers in health systems from our eight partnering countries: Haiti, Lesotho, Liberia, Madagascar, Malawi, Mexico, Peru, and Rwanda.

This goal is achieved through our code in the following two efforts: (1) Monitoring symptoms and other indicators for direct syndromic surveillance work, and (2) By monitoring changes in health service utilization. The latter is done not only as a complement to syndromic surveillance, but also to aid decision making regarding the usage and changes in regular functions of systems in partner sites.

## Modelling technique:
The process starting with the raw data and finishing with the various outputs is referred to as the Data Processing Pipeline (see Figure 1 below):
